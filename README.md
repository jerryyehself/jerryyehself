- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jerryyehself, this git is for some exercises in coding HTML, css, javascript, jQuery, d3.js, and chart.js. May have some python afterwards. There may also data format instance (JSON, XML, RDFs, etc.) in my repostries. 
- About nameing Respostry, format will look like following:
  > data format(*unessential*)-coding language(*unessential*)-project name
